Interpreting 3D coordinates with rotation on 3 axes to 2D output

The purpose of this project "fils de fer" or "wires" (wireframe) is an exercise in using C to visually represent a figure described in a text file.

By stage:
  • validate file formatting as correct per project specifications
  • interpret a properly-formatted text file to xyz integer-only coordinates
  • build functions in C to translate 3D coordinates at any given perspective into 2D, x-y coordinates that would represent the figure
  • develop an algorithm to connect the 2D coordinates to build a wireframe representation
  • use the MLX graphics library provided to output the wireframe pixel-by-pixel to an image file and then relay the image-size buffer to the screen
